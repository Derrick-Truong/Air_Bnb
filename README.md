## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to develop DrBnb:

- **Node.js**: A server-side runtime environment that enabled us to build scalable and high-performance applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library that helped us create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container that helped us manage complex application state across components.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provided a high-level interface for working with our PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database that provided a robust and scalable data storage solution.

## Lesson Learned

Through this project, the two most important things I learned were planning and user experience.

Planning is crucial: Before diving into development, invest time in thorough planning. Define your goals, target audience, features, and design. This helps streamline the development process and ensures a clear vision for your website.

Also, user experience matters: Put yourself in the shoes of your users and prioritize their experience. Create intuitive navigation, optimize page load times, and make sure your website is accessible across different devices and browsers. A positive user experience enhances engagement and encourages return visits.
