Airbnb Clone Project
This is an Airbnb clone project that I am currently working on. The goal of this project is to create a web application that mimics the functionality and design of the Airbnb website.

Project Description

The Airbnb clone project is a web application that allows users to search for and book accommodations in various locations around the world. Users can filter their search results by price range, location, and other criteria. Once a user has found a suitable accommodation, they can book it and make a payment using the integrated payment system.

The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and other technologies such as Node.js and Express for the backend and MongoDB for the database.
